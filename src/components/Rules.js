            <h3>THE GAME OF TRUST </h3>

            <p>During World War I, peace broke out.</p>
            <p>
              It was Christmas 1914 on the Western Front. Despite strict orders
              not to chillax with the enemy,
              <br /> British and German soldiers left their trenches, crossed No
              Man's Land,
              <br /> and gathered to bury their dead, exchange gifts, and play
              games.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile: it's 2019, the West has been at peace for decades, and
              wow, we suck at trust. <br />
              Surveys show that, over the past forty years, fewer and fewer
              people say they trust each other. So here's our puzzle:{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Why, even in peacetime, do friends become enemies? <br />
                And why, even in wartime, do enemies become friends?
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Lets try to explain our epidemic of distrust with game theory!

            <h3>THE GAME OF TRUST </h3>
            <p>
              You have one choice. In front of you is a machine: <br />
              if you put a coin in the machine, the other player gets three
              coins â€“ and vice versa.
            </p>
            <img alt="game" src={image1} className="rules-img"></img>
            <p>
              You both can either choose to <strong>COOPERATE</strong>
              (put in coin), or <strong>CHEAT</strong> (don't put in coin).

            <h3>THE GAME OF TRUST </h3>
            <p>
              Let's say the other player cheats, and doesn't put in a coin.{" "}
            </p>
            <img alt="game" src={image2} className="rules-img"></img>
            <p>
              What should you do? Probably, <strong>CHEAT</strong>

            <h3>THE GAME OF TRUST </h3>
            <p>
              Exactly! Why let that moocher mooch off of you? If you cooperate &
              they cheat, you lose a coin while they gain three. (score: -1 vs
              +3) <br />
              However, if you both cheat, neither of you gain or lose anything.
              (score: 0 vs 0)
              <br />
              <strong>Therefore: you should CHEAT.</strong>
            </p>
            <img alt="game" src={image3} className="rules-img"></img>
            <p>
              <strong>
                But let's say the other player cooperates, and puts in a coin.
              </strong>
              What should you do now? <strong>COOPERATE?</strong>

            <p>
              Sure, seems like the right thing to do...
              <strong>OR IS IT??</strong> <br />
              Because if you both cooperate, you both give up a coin to gain
              three. (score: +2 vs +2) <br />
              But if you cheat & they cooperate, you gain three coins at their
              cost of one. (score: +3 vs -1)
              <strong>Therefore: you "should" still CHEAT.</strong>
              <br />
              <img alt="game" src={image4} className="rules-img"></img>
              <br />
              And that's our dilemma. Trust is nice, but it can let others take
              advantage of you -- or shoot you as you come unarmed out of a
              trench. <br />
              Sometimes, distrust is rational! But now, what happens if we play
              this game in real and will check can you trust another player?
              <br />
              <strong>TRY IT!</strong> And after 5 rounds you will now the truth
