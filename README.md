## Preface

Evolution of trust is a game played between two players.
The players need to enter a game room (any which exists or create a nuew one). At the start of the game, both players have the same amount of coins - 5. 
You have one choice. In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine, the other player gets three coins â€“ and vice versa. You both can either choose to COOPERATE (put in coin), or CHEAT (don't put in coin).
If you cooperate & they cheat, you lose a coin while they gain three. (score: -1 vs +3) However, if you both cheat, neither of you gain or lose anything. (score: 0 vs 0).
If you both cooperate, you both give up a coin to gain three. (score: +2 vs +2) But if you cheat & they cooperate, you gain three coins at their cost of one. (score: +3 vs -1).
And that's our dilemma. Trust is nice, but it can let others take advantage of you -- or shoot you as you come unarmed out of a trench. Sometimes, distrust is rational!
Nobody can win or loose, you just can check - can you really trust your opponent, or can he trust you?
